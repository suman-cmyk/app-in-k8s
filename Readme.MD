# Demo App for Deployment in Kubernetes

This is a simple demo application intended for deployment in Kubernetes (K8s). It demonstrates the basic setup of a containerized application and how it can be deployed and managed within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Purpose

The purpose of this demo app is to provide a hands-on example of deploying an application in Kubernetes. It covers the following aspects:

- Containerization of the application using Docker.
- Creation of Kubernetes deployment and service manifests.
- Deployment of the application in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Getting Started

To get started with deploying this demo app in Kubernetes, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2  Makefile for building and running Docker image

 This Makefile provides targets for building and running a Docker image.
     
   # Usage:
  - Run 'make build' to build the Docker image.
   - Run 'make run' to run a container from the Docker image.
  - Run 'make help' to display usage information.
